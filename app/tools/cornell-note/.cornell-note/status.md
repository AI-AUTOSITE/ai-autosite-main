## 🎯 Design Decisions

### Simplification
- **Removed:** Hero section (reduces scroll, focuses on tool)
- **Removed:** Mobile indicator banner (unnecessary clutter)
- **Removed:** "Include instructions" checkbox (single-page focus)
- **Removed:** "Include research evidence" checkbox (single-page focus)
- **Removed:** Tips section (reduces page length)
- **Removed:** "Why It Works" evidence section (moved to blog)

**Rationale:** Users want a quick template generator, not a full tutorial. Educational content belongs in the blog post.

### PDF Output
- **Single page only:** Note template (Questions + Notes + Summary)
- **No multi-page exports:** Keeps file size small, loading fast
- **Clean, printable layout:** Optimized for A4/Letter printing

## 📝 Notes

### Why Single Page?
Users testing the tool want a quick template, not a manual. The blog post serves as the comprehensive guide with research evidence, how-to steps, and FAQs.

### Why No localStorage?
Keeping it simple. Most users will generate a template once and print it. No need for saved configurations. If demand grows, we can add it later.

### Why No Mobile Banner?
The "Show Preview" button is self-explanatory. No need to tell users "this is mobile optimized"—they'll know by using it.
